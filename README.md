# workboy

A CLI job-application index.

Tell workboy who you've applied to, what you know about them and every time you've spoken to them, and workboy will handle all the clerical work. Way better than a spreadsheet, unless it isn't; you know who you are.

workboy uses continuous user-polling after a record has been opened to make record editing simple and easy.  
Type 'done' to save and finish, or 'show' to see the record updated with your changes.

workboy also uses Regex to smartly interpret your submissions so addresses and phone numbers don't need to be described as such, they simply end up where they're supposed to. You're welcome.

When you're all done, the finished record is easy to pull up at any time by simply giving its name or ID as the only argument to the workboy script.
